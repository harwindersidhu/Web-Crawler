# Web Crawler

A web crawler, also known as a web spider, is a tool that systematically goes through one or more websites to gather information. In this small project, we are building a web crawler in which we will extract names and links to mobile phones that are listed on a Flipkart website.

Modules we used for crawling:

- `request:` For sending HTTP request to the URL
- `cheerio:` For parsing DOM and extracting HTML of web page
- `fs:` For reading or writing the data into the file
